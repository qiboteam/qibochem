    "    - To outperform classical computational chemistry, the energy from the quantum circuit should be lower than this value\n",
    "    - However, depending on the initial set of parameters and the classical optimizer, one might occasionally reach this result as a local minimum\n",
    "- Of course, ideally, the VQE process manages to find the second reference result, the exact solution from diagonalizing the molecular Hamiltonian exactly"
